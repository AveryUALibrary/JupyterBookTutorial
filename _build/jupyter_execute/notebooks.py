# # Content with notebooks
# 
# You can also create content with Jupyter Notebooks. This means that you can include
# code blocks and their outputs in your book.
# 
# ## Markdown + notebooks
# 
# As it is markdown, you can embed images, HTML, etc into your posts!
# 
# ![](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/logo-wide.svg)
# 
# You can also $add_{math}$ and
# 
# $$
# math^{blocks}
# $$
# 
# or
# 
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# \mbox{mean} la_{tex} \\ \\
# math blocks

# But make sure you \$Escape \$your \$dollar signs \$you want to keep!

# ## MyST markdown
# 
# MyST markdown works in Jupyter Notebooks as well. For more information about MyST markdown, check
# out [the MyST guide in Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html),
# or see [the MyST markdown documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
# 
# ## Code blocks and outputs
# 
# Jupyter Book will also embed your code blocks and output in your book.
# For example, here's some sample Matplotlib code:

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    """

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : int
        The recursion depth.
    scale : float

    return x, y


# In[2]:


x, y = koch_snowflake(order=5)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.axis('equal')
plt.fill(x, y)
plt.show()


# There is a lot more that you can do with outputs (such as including interactive outputs)
# with your book. For more information about this, see [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org)
